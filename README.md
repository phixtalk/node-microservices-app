# node-microservices-app

A Simple NodeJs application designed with Microservices Architecture

Here I'm creating a simple Posts --> Comments Application using a Microservice Arch

The app simply lets users create posts and add comments to any post,<br/>
Users can see all posts and comments associated with the posts in a single view.

I am using local storage to hold data since the focus is on the <br/>
microservices design and not on database persistence.

Frontend - Reactjs - $ npx create-react-app client<br/>
Backend Posts Service: $ npm install express cors axios nodemon<br/>
Backend Comments Service: $ npm install express cors axios nodemon

This will be the first of many nodejs, microservices, docker, ci/ci applications
